# NoFlip
SkaterXL mod to prevent flip tricks

Press LB and RB together to activate or deactivate. There are several settings that can be adjusted via shred menu (F8).

Timeout: Turn off after a delay
Disable after pop: The first pop after activating noflip will disable it again. Useful for landing a grind then flipping out.
Disable after respawn: If not using any of the other options then this can be useful to make sure you don't forget it is on when manually activating and disabling.
